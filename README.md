SoftTabNav
=========
SoftTabNav is a simple Sublime Text 3 plugin which makes soft tab indentation behave as normal tabs for arrow-key navigation.

Thus pressing left or right arrow in the indentation of a soft-tabs document will cause the caret to jump to the next soft tab.

This behaviour is equivalent to Atom's atomic soft tabs and Textmate's default soft tab behaviour.
